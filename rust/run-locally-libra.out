<python3> Couldn't find distutils or packaging. We cannot check the current version of the CLI. We will install the latest version.
<python3> Latest CLI release: 3.5.0
<python3> Currently installed CLI: 3.5.0
<python3> Installing 3.5.0
<python3> Determined target to be: Ubuntu-22.04-x86_64
<python3> 
<python3> Welcome to the Aptos CLI installer!
<python3> 
<python3> This will download and install the latest version of the Aptos CLI at this location:
<python3> 
<python3> /home/coin1/.local/bin
<python3> 
<python3> Installing Aptos CLI (3.5.0): Downloading...
<python3> Installing Aptos CLI (3.5.0): Done!
<python3> 
<python3> The Aptos CLI (3.5.0) is installed now. Great!
<python3> 
<python3> To get started you need the Aptos CLI's bin directory (/home/coin1/.local/bin) in your `PATH`
<python3> environment variable.
<python3> 
<python3> Add the following to your shell configuration file (e.g. .bashrc):
<python3> 
<python3> export PATH="/home/coin1/.local/bin:$PATH"
<python3> 
<python3> After this, restart your terminal.
<python3> 
<python3> Alternatively, you can call the Aptos CLI explicitly with `/home/coin1/.local/bin/aptos`.
<python3> 
<python3> You can test that everything is set up by executing:
<python3> 
<python3> aptos info

<cargo-build-sbf>   feature `workspace-inheritance` is required
<cargo-build-sbf> 
<cargo-build-sbf>   The package requires the Cargo feature called `workspace-inheritance`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.62.1 (6177f0d0d 2022-08-01)).
<cargo-build-sbf>   Consider adding `cargo-features = ["workspace-inheritance"]` to the top of Cargo.toml (above the [package] table) to tell Cargo you are opting in to use this unstable feature.
<cargo-build-sbf>   See https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#workspace-inheritance for more information about the status of this feature.
